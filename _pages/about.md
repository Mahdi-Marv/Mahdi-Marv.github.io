I'm a final year B.Sc student majoring in Computer Science at [Sharif University of Technology](https://sharif.edu) in Tehran, Iran. I'm also pursuing a minor in Economics.

During my past bachelor years, I have been working on various research projects in the different domains of Trustworthy AI. Nowadays, I'm preparing myself for graduate studies in my fields of interest.


I have been a member of Prof. [Rohban](https://sharif.ir/~rohban/)'s [RIML lab](https://github.com/rohban-lab) since 2024. There, I have been working on various projects in the fields of outlier detection, and backdoor detection.

Research Interests
=============
Generally, I'm interested in designing safe and efficient intelligent systems. Driven by this interest, I enjoy tackling problems on different domains relevant to Trustworthy AI. Additionally, I enjoy investigating and bringing novel ideas to deep learning architectures, such as transformers. My main areas of interest are:

* Trustworthy & Safe AI
* Security
* Generative AI
* Transformers
* Computer Vision
* Representation Learning
