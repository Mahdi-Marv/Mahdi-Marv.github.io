I'm a final year B.Sc student majoring in Computer Engineering at [Sharif University of Technology](https://sharif.edu) in Tehran, Iran.

During my past bachelor years, I have been working on various research projects in the different domains of Trustworthy AI. Nowadays, I'm preparing myself for graduate studies in my fields of interest.

Currently, I'm a junior research assistant at [Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) under the supervision of Dr. [Pin-Yu Chen](https://sites.google.com/site/pinyuchenpage/home) and Prof. [Tsung-Yi Ho](https://tsungyiho.github.io/) on LLMs security.

I have been a member of Prof. [Rohban](https://sharif.ir/~rohban/)'s [RIML lab](https://github.com/rohban-lab) since 2022. There, I have been working on various projects in the fields of adversarial robustness, outlier detection, and backdoor detection.

In Summer 2023, I was a research intern in [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) under the supervision of Prof. [Goharshady](https://amir.goharshady.com/).
