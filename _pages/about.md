I'm a final year B.Sc student majoring in Computer Science at [Sharif University of Technology](https://sharif.edu) in Tehran, Iran, where I'm also pursuing a minor in Economics.

Throughout my undergraduate years, I have actively contributed to a range of research projects within the diverse field of Trustworthy AI. Currently, I am preparing to pursue graduate studies in my areas of interest.


Since 2024, I have been a member of Prof. [Rohban](https://sharif.ir/~rohban/)'s [RIML lab](https://github.com/rohban-lab), where I have been involved in several projects focused on outlier detection and backdoor detection.

Research Interests
=============
Generally, I'm interested in designing safe and efficient intelligent systems. Driven by this interest, I enjoy tackling problems on different domains relevant to Trustworthy AI. My main areas of interest are:

* Trustworthy & Safe AI
* Cyber Security
* Explainable AI (XAI)
* Medical Imaging & Healthcare
* Computer Vision
* Microeconomics
